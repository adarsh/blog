Last weekend I was up in Boston and some friends and I drove out to the countryside to go apple picking. I have to say, it was hilariously fun. Also, since most of the easy apples had been picked, the job really amounted to a lot of tree-climbing, monkey impressions, and assorted apple-related humor. (William Tell, I'm a Mac, you're PC, etc) Eating apples which are freshly picked is a completely different experience and only goes to prove what an unadulterated cityslicker I've become. They're delicious.
