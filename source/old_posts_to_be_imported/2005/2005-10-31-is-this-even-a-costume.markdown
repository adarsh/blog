I was at Subterranian on Sat for a costume party. Some woman decided it would be appropriate to wear Indian clothes (she's white), a bindi, and carry some sort of ethnic bag as a costume. Yes, she was dressed as an Indian woman. The icing on the cake was when she was doing the Bhangra to every song. Now "Monsoon Wedding" was great and all, but get the fuck out of here.
