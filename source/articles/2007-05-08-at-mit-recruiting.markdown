[![](http://activationenergy.files.wordpress.com/2007/05/img_5648.jpg?w=300)](http://activationenergy.files.wordpress.com/2007/05/img_5648.jpg) I went to Boston to give a recruiting presentation to the MIT kids (who are WAY dorkier than U-C types, by the way) and on the way I saw this bananas looking Frank Gehry-type of thing. Apparently its the [Stata Center ](http://web.mit.edu/evolving/buildings/stata/index.html)which houses all sorts of artificial intelligence, computer science, and philosophy folks.

I'm not sure if this is the coming style of modern architecture, but it looks like a Tim Burton movie set and I like it. I can't imagine what it looks like from the inside...
