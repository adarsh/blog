I just exported posts from my [old site][1]. I used the following tools:

* WordPress - exported the XML file
* [exitwp][2], a python script to convert `XML` to `HTML` and convert to `.md`
* Vim for cleaning up random images, formatting, tags to categories.

There's a lot of bad writing in there and good memories.
