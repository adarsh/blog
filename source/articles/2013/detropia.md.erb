> If you were to visit the Detroit Institute of Arts, home to Diego Rivera’s magnificent murals depicting scenes at the Ford Motor Company in the early nineteen-thirties, and then take a stroll through the surrounding streets, you might be surprised at what you would find: coffee shops frequented by young hipsters; old warehouses being converted to lofts; bike racks; houses undergoing renovation; a new Whole Foods supermarket. After decades of white flight, black flight, and urban decay, Detroit is being spoken of, in some circles, as "the new Portland," or "the new Brooklyn." -[The New York Post, August 5, 2013][1]

[Detropia][2] is the latest documentary ([available on Netflix][3]) focused on
the unique economic state of Detroit and it's revitalization. It is beautiful
and breezy, honest and depressing, lacking in narration. It's a great watch,
but focuses a lot more on Old Detroit than it's future.

It's hard to watch. I wrote <%= link_to('this', '/2009/the-final-straw') %> on
the old blog when things were at their worst (2009). Since then, a lot has
changed, mostly for the better. There is a lot of this "New Brooklyn/Portland"
talk, and the artists have not stopped showing up in the city. As [Richard
Florida writes in the Atlantic][4], Detroit is not dead.

First come the artists, then the gay community, then entrepreneurs, yuppies, and
realtors. Economic vacuums are filled fast.
