Someone asked me today how to strengthen their application for [apprentice.io](http://apprentice.io).

Here is my response, which is what I believe gets you from a beginner to a job as a Rails developer.

### Work

* Launch a simple Rails application. You'll learn more in this process than you will any other way.
* Beef up your GitHub page with solid, well-written, small code examples.
* Write some tests in RSpec. Try to get to 100% coverage (use simplecov to check)

### Technique

* Get excellent at Ruby. Read everything on this page: https://learn.thoughtbot.com/ruby
* Work through Agile Development in Ruby on Rails, Michael Hartl's tutorial
* Start reading about refactoring. Know what 'good code' means.
* Learn Vim. Just stick with it and you'll be faster.

### Learn

* Read Ruby Weekly
* Listen to Ruby Rogues podcast
* Check Hacker News and read up on current events

### Network

* Attend meetups and hack nights. Work on a project with someone else. Learn from them and say thanks.
* Keep in touch with everyone you met, send them emails, have coffee with them.
* Join a Ruby mailing list (not ruby6) and participate.

### Show interest

* Know everything about people/companies before you meet them (Tweets/Blogs/Linkedin/Googling).
* Show up 10-15 minutes early for interviews.
* Put on a jacket.
* Be humble.
