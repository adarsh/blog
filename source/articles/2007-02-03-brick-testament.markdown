If you are the type who checks up on Wikipedia to learn more about random stuff (like me) I would suggest a visit to the [Brick Testament](http://www.thebricktestament.com/). This is essentially Lego renditions of scenes from the Bible and is one of my main sources of religious information. I highly recommend it.

My favorite section is "The Law", from which this photo was taken.
