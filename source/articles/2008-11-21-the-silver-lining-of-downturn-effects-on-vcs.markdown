A [Post](http://www.pehub.com/23994/the-silver-lining/) from peHUB on effect of the downturn on VCs.

> Down markets sharpen our focus on what is really important. Bottom line, if
> we are not building real, viable businesses that meet real needs in real
> markets, we’re delusional and should probably be doing something else. Having
> a viable business means that people will pay enough for your products or
> services with sufficient demand to sustain a cash flow positive business.
> Cash is always king, but in down markets, this is more evident and obvious to
> all.

> The silver lining of any downturn is that you can spot the next wave if you
> look carefully enough. This downturn likely marks the end of the first wave
> of the cleantech/greentech/sustainable technology revolution. Disruptive
> technologies are adopted in two waves. The first wave is characterized by
> exuberance and overinvestment and is invariably followed by a crash. The
> second wave is always an order of magnitude larger than the first. It should
> be no different with clean, green and sustainable technology.
