Skiing is amazing here. The view is like nothing I've ever seen, and photographs don't really convey the essence of it. I feel pretty lucky to be on vacation and the people I'm with are pretty interesting. One guy I'm with has done 100-mile marathons and has biked from Alaska to the tip of South America and another woman regularly competes in dragon boat competitions. More pictures to follow. [![Posted by Picasa](http://photos1.blogger.com/pbp.gif)](http://picasa.google.com/blogger/)
