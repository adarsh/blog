There's a great place in Soho called [Evolution](http://theevolutionstore.com/)
which is essentially an art gallery filled with natural items including shells,
butterflies, rocks, and skeletons. It's a pretty fascinating place and taps
into the beautiful part of nature. I bought an interesting sucker which I've
photographed here. I'm especially fond of the ingredients
list.[![](http://activationenergy.files.wordpress.com/2007/02/img_5506.jpg?w=300)](http://activationenergy.files.wordpress.com/2007/02/img_5506.jpg)
