I am currently a fresh tranplant to New York. I have already found myself cursing out tourists and bustling about. As of yet, I do not have access to my apartment and no address (curiously, you need an address to get a PO box) but its beginning to set in that I live here now. 

Some observations: women here have to have both hands occupied with some combination of the following - coffee, dog leash, shopping bag, phone, man, or purse. Both hands. Swinging wildly. 

I'm not clear where the money goes, but somehow it gets spent at a much more rapid clip here than anywhere else. Also, even though I've given up coffee, I find myself drinking copious amounts in The City. No idea why. 

Its fun and there is a lot of life and character, especially in Brooklyn where I'm staying. I hope at some point I stop looking like a tourist.
