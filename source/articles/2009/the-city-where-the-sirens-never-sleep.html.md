Article from the Weekly Standard on the slow death of Detroit. My favorite
excerpt:


> But with millions of jobs on the line, including their own, the Detroit Three
> honchos went to Washington to endure the kabuki theater, first in their
> private jets, then in their sad little hybrids. All to get their slats kicked
> in by Congress (and who has been more profligate than they) in order to
> secure a bridge loan to withstand an economy wrecked by others who'd secured
> no-strings bailouts before them. The absurdist spectacle was best summed up
> by car aficionado Jay Leno: "People who are trillions of dollars in debt,
> yelling at people who are billions of dollars in debt."

Looks like Jay Leno can be witty afterall.Â 

EDIT: Also this fun view into the long roots of the auto industry

> Like many Detroiters (he lives in a posh suburb, where houses on his block
> have remained unsold for six years), he's bracing for one or all of the Big
> Three going down. He predicts millions will be thrown out of work, right down
> to the diner owner in Utah who serves lunch to the people who produce the
> screws which are bought by the widget manufacturers who produce a component
> that goes into a seat of a Ford automobile. The diner owner thought he wasn't
> in the auto business. "But he was," says Vines. "He just didn't know it."
