[![Washed Out Youtube link](http://img.youtube.com/vi/krx6wDSrbBE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krx6wDSrbBE)

New favorite song/band discovered
as the theme song for Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein's
"Portlandia"
([New Yorker Review of Season 2](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/01/02/120102fa_fact_talbot)),
which is a hipster show which makes fun of hipsters. Also, it's funny.

I'm a sucker for sentimental music, which this certainly is.
It reminds me of [Boards of Canada](http://amzn.to/1l9LcOl)
in a way (Great retro video for
"[ROYGBIV](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yT0gRc2c2wQ)"). Or the more obscure
"[Casino vs. Japan](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006G9ZN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=whmomyth-20&linkId=7ae4b7211c1b3201fe6b42439e6f2b8b)"
(their amazing "Aquarium"
([youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzK1YYldoic))

Anyhow, enjoy.
