Today's selection is from [Jenny Lewis](http://www.jennylewis.com/)'
really phenomenal 2006 album
"[Rabbit Fur Coat](http://amzn.to/1MCeScK)" 
recorded with the [Watson Twins](http://thewatsontwins.com).
Since she's got a long acting resume in addition to fronting
[Rilo Kiley](http://rilokiley.com/),
she gets a lot of comparisons to
 [Zooey Deschanel](http://amzn.to/20xS48v)
(latter better actress, former better musician).

Anyhow, this song feels like the right way to start the year on an upbeat note.
(Note: this song is not nearly as angry as the title may lead you to believe)

Happy New Year!
