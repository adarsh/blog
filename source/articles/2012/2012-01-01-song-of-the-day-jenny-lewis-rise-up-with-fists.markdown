Today's selection is from [Jenny Lewis](http://www.jennylewis.com/home)' really phenomenal 2006 album "[Rabbit Fur Coat](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQQHPY/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&tag=whmomyth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000CQQHPY)" recorded with the [Watson Twins](http://www.thewatsontwins.com/). Since she's got a long acting resume in addition to fronting [Rilo Kiley](http://www.thewatsontwins.com/), she gets a lot of comparisons to [Zooey Deschanel](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012IWHQO/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&tag=whmomyth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0012IWHQO) (latter better actress, former better musician).

Anyhow, this song feels like the right way to start the year on an upbeat note. (Note: this song is not nearly as angry as the title may lead you to believe)

Happy New Year!
