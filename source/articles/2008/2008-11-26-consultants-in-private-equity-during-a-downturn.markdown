article and a [blog post

on use of management consultants during the downturn to help improve execution
at portfolio companies.

My favorite section:


> There is a mentality among many young MBA types who think that since they

Classic. Another great moment in the [Bankers vs Consultants
debate](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROlDmux7Tk4).

The quick summary is that you'll always need bankers to run your deals but in
tough times you need someone with actual management experience/skill to extract
value from your portfolio companies or you're toast. (Note: You should be doing
this in good times also, but when you're drowning in cash like Scrooge McDuck,
no one bothers, the same way that investment banks don't bother to manage their
own expenses during booms)
