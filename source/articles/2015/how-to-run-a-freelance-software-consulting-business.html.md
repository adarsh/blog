I have been a consultant for ten years
in one capacity or another.
I've been a technology consultant for three years
and sold development services
for most of that time.

These days, I'm a freelance developer
writing Ruby and JavaScript
and helping set up good development routines
to help teams be super productive and happy.

Frequently, I get asked for advice
on how to build a consulting business.
Usually the people asking are
developers just starting out.

When I share whatever I know,
I usually ask the other person to keep me posted
on how things turn out.
I'm always curious to know
if anything I've said was actually useful
so I can stop boring people if when it's not.

A few months ago, I spoke with someone
starting a software consulting business with his friend.

Some months after we spoke,
he wrote to let me know
things were going well
and they'd landed some clients.
(I very rarely ever hear back from people later,
so this was awesome for me!)
Apparently, some of what I said was useful
and fortunately for me,
he took notes and shared them back with me.

I'm going to turn these notes into
a few posts summarizing things I say a lot
in hopes it helps someone out.

More importantly,
I'm hoping sharing whatever I know
can turn "sales" from
something slimy and manipulative
into clear and honest tactics
for growing a small business.
