As I wrote in [this post][1],
I'm sharing what I know about
consulting in the hope it's helpful for others.

This post focuses on how to generate sales leads or
"finding people who are interested in paying you."

Everything here I learned as a freelance
management consultant,
while selling millions of dollars of work
for a medium-sized boutique firm,
and now as a freelance developer.

## Preface

It's a weird thing to hire someone else
and pay them for their time.

The relationship requires trust above all else.
Once one party loses trust in the other,
it's best to move on, re-evaluate what happened,
and find other work.
As such everything you do
needs to be authentic, honest, and professional,
including trying to drum up business.

Also it's worth noting these tactics work best
when you do them very consistently
for a long time.
There's no substitute for building good routines
and doing the work.

Finally, it should be noted
that I am by no means perfect at sales
and your mileage may vary.

Okay let's start:

## Networking

### Specific Tactics I Use

* Keep a list of people to stay in touch with.
* Be sure to follow up regularly. Use tools to automate the process.
  I like to send a reminder to [`every2months@followup.cc`][2] with
  the subject line "Get Coffee With PERSON" and get reminded regularly.
  Repeating calendar invites are great for this as well.
* Be Helpful 1: Make introductions on behalf of people you think might
  benefit from meeting each other.
* Be Helpful 2: Forward articles/videos/tweets/etc to people if you think
  they'll find it interesting / relevant.
* Don't spend time with people you don't like.
* Send them articles when you think they may find them interesting. [Here's an
  old post where I talk about doing it with Google Reader][reader post], which
  tells you how old the post is.

The goal of these activities
is to make "business friends"
whom you like, and who like you.
If you don't like someone,
or are just hanging out with them
because you feel you have to,
it won't work.

You should be helpful to them,
recommending candidates to hire,
articles to read,
people to meet,
and services to try.

You should ask them for advice frequently.
You should ask them for help rarely.
You should support their businesses,
retweet their product announcements,
and support their crowdfunding campaigns,
_but only do so because you feel like it_.

I should note
that every job I've ever gotten
has been a result of networking.
I'm guessing this is broadly true.

### Why Do This

First of all,
you make business friends to learn.
Asking questions helps you understand
what other companies and situations are like
which helps you handle your own thing.

Second of all, it feels good to help people,
or rather it should.
If it doesn't,
there's a whole other set of problems to address.

But really,
the reason you get to know a lot of people
is to be top of mind when they need help.

An example is:
Sally works at a company
and hears
"oh we need to get help with this Rails app,"
and thinks
"I wonder if my friend YOUR_NAME knows someone, or can help..."

Then they call you,
and you have a discussion about how helpful you can be
(if at all).
Be sure to let them know
if you're the wrong person for the job
but maybe you know who the right person is.

All of this should feel authentic.
If it feels slimy or manipulative to you,
it will seem that way to everyone,
and you won't build trust (see above).


## Content Marketing: Writing

### Specific Tactics I Use

* Set up a blog which clearly states you are hirable and what skills you have.
* Blog and tweet as regularly as you can about your work.
  The content should be solid, but quantity and regularity matter much more.
* If you do something neat for a client, use their name (with permission).
  They may cross-promote your post for you.
* Try using an editorial board in Trello to build a pipeline of ideas
  which you can push along into posts.
* Set regular writing goals like one post per week, one hour a day, etc.
* Promote your posts using Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Facebook, whatever.
  You can use [Buffer] to automate this stuff.
* Find a pal who is good at writing to edit your posts before going out.
  I have everything in GitHub and ask for reviews using pull requests.

### Why Do This

Writing blog posts is the highest leverage activity you can engage in.
In other words,
you can reach the most people
per unit time of effort.

Also, posts last forever
and the longer they're around
the more likely they are to be read.

Finally, your writing is representative of
what you are like to work with.
If it's clear and well-edited,
it'll signal how you take care in your work.
If you share interesting perspectives,
it likely means you'll have valuable things to say
when someone hires you.
If you write very regularly,
it clearly demonstrates discipline.

## Content Marketing: Speaking

### Specific Tactics I Use

* Write a ton of articles. Seriously, as many as you can.
* Some of them will get a lot of traction. You'll know because people will
  tweet them and maybe contact you. Analytics could help here also.
* Write a 5-10 minute talk about the most popular topic.
* Ask to give that talk at a meetup. Organizers are always looking for
  good technical material as long as you're not shamelessly selling something.
* Big meetups record or stream the video content.  Watch the recording to
  see how you did. Also ask others at the meeting for feedback.
* Keep giving this talk. In other words, practice.
* Expand the talk to something bigger.
* Use the expanded talk and video as submission materials for conferences.
* Go to conferences and meet all the other nice people.

### Why Do This

Talks help promote your articles, which in turn promote your consulting business.

In addition, speaking publicly makes you seem approachable and gives shy people
a great excuse to talk to you, which is the goal - networking and making
friends in your field of work.

Finally, it's a lot of fun.

## Then What?

How do you handle all of this crazy sales demand
now that you are a big shot?

People will find a way to get in touch with you.
You could add an interest form to your blog
to increase the volume,
but note that comes with a decrease in quality.

You may need something like a CRM
if you're going to run a firm
with other people as employees.

If it's just you, don't bother.
Use something like Trello to keep info in one place,
and follow-up regularly with interested parties.

My next post will be on how to actually close these leads.
