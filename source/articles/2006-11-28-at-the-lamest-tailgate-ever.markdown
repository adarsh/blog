So I went to the Harvard-Yale game tailgate at my special lady-friend's behest.
I was told it was supposed to be a wild, fun time filled with smartypants
getting wasted and being clever. Instead I found a truck with posterboard and
marker denoting the *combined* tailgate of two whole Harvard College classes.
That means of the, oh, I don't know, 2000 graduates of the most prestigious
college in the US, about 14 sheepish goofballs gathered around a hot grill and
icy cooler for free beers and discussion of graduate school on what is
advertised as the biggest alumni social event of the year.

Let me be the first to say GO BLUE.

ADVICE: If you are not in some sort of grad school when you get to the 4th or
5th year out of college (even art or music school), don't show up to the H-Y
game. People will mock you and your earning potential.
