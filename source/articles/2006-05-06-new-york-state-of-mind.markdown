I'm in the NYC looking for apts (I found a cool one in Soho) and as usual all kinds of weird shit is happening all around me. Here are some pics from the last few days:

This is a guy on the subway singing "Jealous Guy" while sharing the bench with a passed out guy with his pants around his ankles.

This is a street in the financial district which takes advantage of the deserted nature after hours and puts tables in the middle of the street where all of the restaurants serve food. Eating in the middle of the street sounds kind of strange but its one of the coolest places I've ever seen - like a street fair but at night and more of a diner.
